*DESCRIPTION*: I've created a comprehensive mobile app redesign prototype that addresses Instagram's content overwhelm problem. The redesign introduces several key improvements:

ðŸŽ¯ Main Problem Solved: Instagram users often feel overwhelmed by endless mixed content that doesn't match their current interests or mood.

ðŸ’¡ Key Features:

Focus Mode Toggle: Curates content based on user interests to reduce cognitive load

Smart Interest Filters: Quick category filtering for targeted content discovery

Enhanced Content Cards: Better information hierarchy with tags and preview text

Mindful Design: Encourages quality engagement over passive scrolling

The interactive prototype demonstrates responsive design, smooth animations, and includes detailed explanations of each improvement and its expected impact. Click the "?" icon in the app to view the full analysis of the redesign decisions and expected user benefits.
